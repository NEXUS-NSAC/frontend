      "details": "The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a standardized system used to measure and communicate the quality of the air in a specific location. It provides a numerical value that corresponds to the concentration of pollutants, such as ground-level ozone, particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The AQI scale typically ranges from 0 to 500, where lower values indicate better air quality, while higher values signify harmful levels of pollution that can pose health risks. Different categories, such as \"Good,\" \"Moderate,\" and \"Hazardous,\" help the public understand the severity of air pollution. AQI plays a crucial role in environmental health, guiding individuals and policymakers in making informed decisions to protect human health and the environment."

      "range":5,
      "details": "Glacier Mass Balance refers to the difference between the amount of ice a glacier gains and loses over a specific period, typically a year. It is a critical indicator of a glacier’s health and the broader impacts of climate change. Positive mass balance occurs when a glacier accumulates more snow and ice than it loses through melting, sublimation, or calving, leading to glacier growth. Conversely, negative mass balance means that the glacier is shrinking, contributing to rising sea levels. Monitoring glacier mass balance is essential for understanding how glaciers are responding to global temperature changes and their role in freshwater availability and ocean circulation."
