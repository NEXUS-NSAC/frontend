By drawing from satellite data and global datasets, NEXUS 1.0 provides near real-time insights into how environmental factors like atmospheric temperature, carbon emissions, and water quality impact Earth’s five spheres: the geosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and cryosphere. Through interactive simulations and visualizations, users can see how changes in one system—such as an increase in global temperatures—ripple through other systems, leading to effects like sea-level rise or changes in biodiversity. NEXUS 1.0 empowers users to visualize Earth’s delicate balance and explore how human actions shape the future of the planet.",
