    range:50,
    details: 'Greenhouse gases (GHGs), including carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4), are atmospheric gases that trap heat from the sun, contributing to the warming of the Earth’s surface—a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect. CO2 is primarily released from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, while CO results from incomplete combustion processes. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is released during activities like livestock farming, oil and gas production, and the decomposition of organic waste. These gases are major drivers of climate change, as they increase the Earth\'s average temperature, disrupt weather patterns, and intensify extreme events such as heatwaves and storms. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is crucial for mitigating global warming and achieving climate stability.'

    details: 'Erosion rates refer to the speed at which soil, rock, or sediment is worn away from the Earth\'s surface due to natural forces such as wind, water, ice, or human activities. Factors like rainfall, vegetation cover, land use, and soil composition influence how quickly erosion occurs in a given area. High erosion rates can lead to loss of fertile soil, reduced agricultural productivity, and degradation of ecosystems. Human activities, such as deforestation, urbanization, and poor land management, often accelerate erosion, contributing to issues like desertification and sedimentation in rivers and oceans. Monitoring and managing erosion rates is critical for environmental sustainability and land conservation.'

    details: 'Snow cover duration refers to the length of time that a specific area is covered by snow during a year. It is an important factor in regulating local climate, water resources, and ecosystems, as snow reflects sunlight (albedo effect), helping to cool the Earth\'s surface. The duration of snow cover varies depending on geographic location, altitude, and climate conditions. Changes in snow cover duration, particularly reductions due to rising atmospheric temperatures, can disrupt water availability for regions that rely on snowmelt and affect ecosystems that depend on consistent snow cover. Monitoring snow cover duration is vital for understanding the impacts of climate change, particularly in polar and mountainous regions.'
